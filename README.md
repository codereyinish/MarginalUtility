This is a simple program I have been coding to calculate the maximum total utility that can be gained from the purchase combination of two choices. Let me explain to beginner who has zero knowledge of MicroEconomics. Lets say you have &5 to spend and you can spend that $5 on either pizzas or chocolates. Lets say we decided to eat only pizza, obviously when you eat for the first time, the satisfaction or dopamine hit  or happiness whatever you say , shoots , say positively to 100 utils, (like miles is a unit for distance ,utils is a unit to measure utility or satisfaction ). Now what will be your satisfaction level when you eat second pizza, it is definitely lower than 1st pizza(Catch is you are only eating same pizza).. In economics, the difference or margin between two utilities is called Marginal Utility.. Now the rate of change in satisfaction(Marginal Utility for Math Nerds) will be decrease and finally become zero.. Another term here is Total Utility which measures the total of all utilities gained  from each pizza. It will be always >= max utility as long as rate of change in marginal utility is not +ve..or marginal utilty is not -ve. marginal Utility can be +ve , 0 or -ve but total utility can never be 0..
Now our main objective is to find the best possible combination of purchase of two items such that combined total utility is maximum..
If you find it overwhelming to read, you can summarize it from CHATGPT though...
